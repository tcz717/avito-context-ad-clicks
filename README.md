[Kaggle:Avito Context Ad Clicks](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-context-ad-clicks)
=================================

In Russia, if you're looking to sell a tractor, a designer dress, a vintage lunchbox, or even a house, your first stop will likely be Avito.ru. As the largest general classified website in Russia, Avito connects buyers and sellers across the world's biggest country.

Sellers are highly motivated to place ads on Avito, hoping to gain attention from the site's 70 million unique monthly visitors. There are three different types of ads available to sellers on Avito: regular, highlighted, and context. 

Context ads are seen as the best way to target users with goods and services. Currently, Avito uses general statistics on ad performance to drive the placement of context ads. Their existing model ignores individual user behavior, making it difficult to predict which ad will be the most relevant for (and earn the most clicks from) each potential buyer. 

In this competition, Avito is challenging you to improve on their model by predicting if individual users will click a given context ad. To create the most robust model and fun competition possible, Avito has provided eight comprehensive relational datasets for you to explore. This competition will help Avito more accurately predict click-through rates for their ads, creating a world where both buyers and sellers win.
